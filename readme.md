# Description

As I planned many month ago now that I confirm that I want to continue on learning code I'm back with lovely language "PHP" I forgot many things so I've done this project to be used to procedural code .

I've done this project first in JS few months ago and now on php so its pretty cool to see how its easy to adapt the code when you already write it before so I'm happy with the result there is some miss that I haven't found useful to push through like adding log out function in this case it was not my focus just been able to create an account , connect it and create or modify character based on Shingeki no Kyojin work.
